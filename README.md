### Dependencies
- Spring Dev Tools, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Lombok, & MySQL Driver
### Application Architecture
React Web Application <-> Spring boot Rest API Service

### Annotations
- `@RestController` is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot that is used to create RESTful web services. It is a combination of two annotations:
  - ‚úÖ @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
  - ‚úÖ `@Controller`: Marks the class as a Spring MVC controller (i.e., a class that handles web requests).
  - ‚úÖ `@ResponseBody`: Tells Spring to write the return value of the method directly to the HTTP response body, instead of trying to render a Thymeleaf or JSP template.
- `@RequestMapping` is an annotation in Spring used to map HTTP requests to handler methods or classes. It‚Äôs one of the core annotations for building web applications and REST APIs in Spring.
- `@CrossOrigin` annotation in Spring Boot is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a REST controller or a specific handler method. This is necessary when your frontend (like Angular, React, etc.) is hosted on a different domain or port than your backend, and you want to allow it to make HTTP requests to your Spring Boot API.
- `@Service` is a Spring annotation used to mark a class as a service layer component in your application.
  - ‚úÖ üìå What it does:
    - a. Tells Spring ‚ÄúHey, this class holds business logic.‚Äù
    - b. It makes the class a Spring-managed bean, so it can be autowired into other components like controllers or other services.
- `@Transactional` is a Spring annotation that manages transactions automatically for you ‚Äî meaning it ensures that a block of code (usually a method) runs within a database transaction.
  - ‚úÖ üîß What it does:
  - a. Starts a transaction before the method runs.
  - b. Commits the transaction if the method completes successfully.
  - c. Rolls back the transaction if the method throws an exception.
